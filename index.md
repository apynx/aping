This is the demo and documentation for Oinam Jekyll Theme. The [Styleguide]({{ site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/styleguide/) has the demonstation of all content features and options you can use. I wrote [an article](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/) about how and why I built this Jekyll Theme.

> The [source](https://github.com/oinam/oinam-jekyll) is hosted on Github and you can [download](https://github.com/oinam/oinam-jekyll/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) a zipped version of the source code.

### Ruby Gem

The theme is also available as a [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/oinam-jekyll). This will be the least updated. Minor fixes and changes will <mark>NOT</mark> be reflected here quickly enough.

## Layouts

1. `home` layout where you can have content blurbs on the top and the last few recent posts.
2. `blog` layout that lists the titles of the posts along with the years as the headings.
3. `page` layout for pages.
4. `post` layout for posts.

### Color

There are three basic color themes included -- `default`, [nord](https://www.nordtheme.com), and `vintage`. Treat them as samples for you to make your own. If you are tinkering with the code, you will find it as easy as just changing few color (HEX) values in the CSS. If you want to pick one of the three, pick a choice in `_config.yml`.
